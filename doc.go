// Package gocqlx is a Scylla / Cassandra productivity toolkit for `gocql`. It's
// similar to what `sqlx` is to `database/sql`.
//
// It contains wrappers over gocql types that provide convenience methods which
// are useful in the development of database driven applications. Under the
// hood it uses sqlx/reflectx package so sqlx models will also work with gocqlx.
